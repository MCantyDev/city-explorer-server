# Purpose of Routes

This directory contains the route definitions for the application. 

Routes define the paths which the server responds to, along with the handlers that process those requests. 

## Files and Structure

- **Routes.go** - **Central file** where all routes are processed for the application.

- **UserRoutes.go** - Defines the routes for **user-related** API requests.

- **CityRoutes.go** - Defines the routes for **city-related** API requests.

## Usage

- Add new route files **as needed** for different features.

- When adding a new route, **ensure the appropriate handler is linked**.
